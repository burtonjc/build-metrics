BuildMetrics
=========================

## Overview
A Rally Software app built using the Rally AppSDK. You can give the app any number of Rally BuildDefinitions and it will aggregate them together over a time interval to present you with metrics about your builds. Current metrics include:

* Build counts for how many times each of your builds has ran
* Newest build
* Oldest build
* Average "green light" time per day
* Build success rate
* Average time for the light to "go green" when the build is broken
* How long the light has been green
